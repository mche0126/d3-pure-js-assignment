                    Since the first industrial revolution, the world steps into the Age of Machines. 
                    The evolution of technology helped all human beings to have an easier life. 
                    However, due to the rapid growth of personal vehicles, traffic efficiency and safety become topics that all countries cannot ignore. 
                    Among them, the traffic mortality rate is the top priority. However, the cause of the road death consists of different aspects. 
                    For many years, researchers and governments have found the factors that lead to unsafe traffic environment and methods to minimize transportation risks. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, this project is created to help analysis the road death and saving lives. 2 main points are foused based on the research and time limitation. 
                    These two points are heavy vehicles and victim group. However, the harzard are not limited to these two factors. In further research or later project,
                    speed limit at scene venue and drunk drive can be take in consideration as well.
                    <br><br>
